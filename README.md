# MyPage----A simple Java Web application
#### It has used Spring to create beans, Spring MVC to control request, Hibernate to control data, and MySql as database.
#### It has two main sections.
## Section ONE ----- [Blog](https://github.com/TrafalgarRicardoLu/MyPage)
### It will used as my own blog.
- **Index**
    - All the css style sources were downloading from Internet.If you want to use the CSS code.[Click Here](https://github.com/TrafalgarRicardoLu/MyPage/tree/master/src/main/webapp/assets/css)<br/>
    - It will show articles from most recent to the oldest and 3 articles on each page.
  
- **Article**
    - Every page contains three part: head, content and foot.You can see a huge picture
     on the top and content followed next.At button, you can choose  turning to previous article or next.
    - I prefer to use least page to achieve most, so I use ONE page to show articles.The server just sent small data instead of another jsp when connected.
## Section TWO ----- [LibraryManagementSystem](https://github.com/TrafalgarRicardoLu/MyPage/tree/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp/user)(NOT FINISHED)
