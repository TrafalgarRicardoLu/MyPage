# MyPage

### It's my own page and blog
- **Index**
    - It will show articles from most recent to the oldest and 3 articles on each page.
  
- **Blog**
    - Every page contains three part: head, content and foot.You can see a huge picture
     on the top and content followed next.At button, you can choose  turning to previous article or next.
    - I prefer to use least page to achieve most, so I use ONE jsp to show articles.The server just sent small data instead of another jsp when connected.
